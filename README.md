Smart Sonar Surveillance System (4S)
📌 Overview

The Smart Sonar Surveillance System (4S) is a defense-inspired prototype that combines an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and a Raspberry Pi to simulate a low-cost radar/sonar surveillance system. The system performs continuous scanning in a semi-circular arc (0–180°), measures object distances, and visualizes them in a radar-style interface. Audible alerts are triggered when objects are detected within a critical range.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how accessible hardware and software integration can be used to simulate real-world defense surveillance systems, with potential applications in both military and civilian domains.

🎯 Features

Continuous scanning (0–180°) with ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo.

Real-time radar-style visualization using Python (Matplotlib/Pygame).

Audible alerts for detected objects at critical distance thresholds.

Modular design: can be expanded with additional sensors or AI-based detection.

Low-cost and easily replicable using off-the-shelf components.

🛠️ Hardware Requirements

Raspberry Pi 4 (any model with GPIO support will work).

Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04).

Micro Servo (SG90).

Breadboard and jumper wires.

330 Ω resistor + another close value resistor (e.g., 470 Ω) for safe GPIO voltage divider.

💻 Software Requirements

Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit recommended).

Python 3.x.

Required libraries:

pip install RPi.GPIO gpiozero matplotlib


(Optional) Pygame for advanced radar visualization.

📐 System Architecture

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) → Measures distance.

Servo Motor (SG90) → Rotates sensor in semi-circular arc.

Raspberry Pi → Controls hardware, processes data, and generates visualization.

Output → Radar-like sweep with alerts for detected objects.

🚀 How It Works

The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor step by step.

At each step, the sensor measures distance to the nearest object.

Data (angle + distance) is collected and plotted on a radar-like interface.

If the distance is less than a set threshold, an audible alarm is triggered.

📌 Applications

Military bases – perimeter intrusion detection.

Border security – unauthorized crossing alerts.

Naval & maritime operations – simplified SONAR prototype.

Civilian – smart home security or warehouse monitoring.

📈 Future Work

Add AI-based detection (e.g., classify moving vs. static objects).

Integrate networking for remote monitoring.

Expand range with advanced sensors.

Upgrade from ultrasonic to RF-based radar for higher realism.

📷 Demo (coming soon)

Screenshots and demo videos will be added once the prototype is completed.
